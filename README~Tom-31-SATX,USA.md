- 👋 Hi, I’m @sleepingparty (Tom IRL)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... the corroding nature of, and, subsequently, ways of maintaining the U.S.A.'s Constitution's Bill of Rights' outline of promises and permanently endowed qualities assigned to all **_legal citizens_**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... navigation of the U.S.A.'s private medical system
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... humorous webcomic ideas or contributions - for both of which, you will, of course, receive credit where it's due (e.g. your name or online alias - or both - and the contribution(s) you are responsible for.
-                                       Such contributions which constituted _improvements_to the webcomic, if only due to the inclusion of that certain something special everyone uniquely has to offer, their brand of je ne sais quoi, as it were.
-                                       Furthermore, to increase the enticements/form a small basket of benefits that are being outlined here as incentive to join in getting funny, not worrying about technical drawing prowess, and creating something others will enjoy.
-                                       Obviously, though, it truly goes without saying, and needn't even be acknowledged, because once you submit a slightly humorous 2-, or 4-, or 50-panel comic, the feeling of achieving self-actualization - the pinnacle and overall aim/goal each human being strives to reach.
-                                       Why? Because it represents a life's implementation of good deeds, vigorous and unwaning pursuing of the refinement of one's abilities in a given field to be considered a "master" who then relishes in helping humanity with the honed, perfected ability, leaving no party the lesser.
-                                       To live from the highest point of human development accroding to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the effect on you, the contributor, should be a profound personal intense boost in your sense of self-esteem and your self-assessment of the level to which you credit the world.
-                                       You will hold a personal genuine belief of having contributed more than a "net positive" to the history of the world, and the history of humanity will forever receive your personal touch of genius that serves as a credit to the whole of humanity.
-                                       From imagining back to The Budddha, Siddhartha Gautama, Indian philosopher and the founder of Buddhism (623 or 563 BCE – 543 or 483 BCE) to the far-future where humanity developed an AI that eventually mimicked the goal of total universal asssimilation, the goal of Star Trek's "Borg" civilization.                                        a summary/self-plug opportunity to promote your online or real-world presence's impact in whatever field of interest it is that strikes your interest, 
- 📫 How to reach me ...tom5@usa.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: ...fuck off  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I'm a straight male with a penis, and the fact that the traits of a person determined their pronouns for millenia and now we must ask or "never know" is a pitiful thought to me.
